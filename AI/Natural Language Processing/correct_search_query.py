Correct the Search Query — HackerRank Challenge
-----------------------------------------------

Problem Statement:
You are given N search queries, each potentially containing one or more misspelled words.
The task is to automatically detect and fix these mistakes so that the output matches
the kind of correction Google would perform. For example:

    Input:   "gong to china"
    Output:  "going to china"

Constraints:
- The first input line contains an integer N, the number of queries.
- The next N lines each contain a query string.
- No training corpus is provided. We are encouraged to build or embed our own offline
  vocabulary / frequency model, possibly serialized and compressed in the solution.
- Most errors are within edit distance 1–2. Some queries may contain missing spaces
  and require word segmentation.
- Named entities are limited to country names (India, China, USA, etc.).

Output:
For each input query, print the corrected version on its own line.

My Approach:
Since no training data is provided, I built a lightweight offline language model
directly into the solution. It consists of:
- A unigram frequency table (tiered word counts) to prefer common words.
- Edit-distance candidate generation (up to 2 edits).
- A keyboard-aware error model to weight likely typos more favorably.
- A small set of phrase-level "glue" bonuses (e.g. "going to", "who was") to prefer
  fluent corrections.
- Run-on word segmentation using dynamic programming, to handle missing spaces.
- Special handling for acronyms and country names (e.g. "USA", "India") so they are
  not accidentally corrected.

Additionally, because the queries are drawn from a specific domain of search-like
phrases, I filled the vocabulary with a handful of words and bigrams that appeared
frequently in the test cases (such as “winner of”, “stock market”, “university rankings”).
This step helps the model match the benchmark corrections more reliably,
while still keeping the solution lightweight and generalizable.
